            Everything began with a story of friendship. Some 25 years ago,
            three passionate friends decided to put together their passion for
            people and places to create a new concept in travel. We called it
            Tellus – the Latin word for Earth – because that was exactly what we
            wanted to offer to our clients.
          </p>
          <p className="lato-reg text-center md:w-3/5 mt-4 md:mt-8 story">
            Over the years, Tellus grew into a healthy company with four
            distinct facets and bit by bit like-minded people joined in and the
            Tellus team matured into a larger family of travel enthusiasts,
            ready to share their passion which is as fresh as day one.
