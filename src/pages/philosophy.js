            Travel means discovery and new experiences. We strive for
            responsible tourism as defined in the 2002 Cape Town Declaration:
            <br />
            <br className="hidden lg:block" />
            To minimize negative economic, environmental and social impacts.
            <br />
            <br className="hidden lg:block" />
            To make positive contributions to the conservation of natural and
            cultural heritage, to the maintenance of the worldâ€™s diversity.
            <br />
            <br className="hidden lg:block" />
            To provide more enjoyable experiences for tourists through
            meaningful connections with local people and to provide a greater
            understanding of local cultural, social and environmental issues.
            <br />
            <br className="hidden lg:block" />
            All our programs are designed to have a minimal impact on the local
            environment.

            Over the years, Tellus grew into a healthy company with four
            distinct facets and bit by bit like-minded people joined in and the
            Tellus team matured into a larger family of travel enthusiasts,
            ready to share their passion which is as fresh as day one.
