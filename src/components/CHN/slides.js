    description: `Its modern face is dazzling, but China is no one-trick pony. The 
    world's oldest continuous civilisation isn't all smoked glass and brushed aluminium, and 
    while you won't be tripping over artefacts – three decades of round-the-clock development 
    and rash town planning have taken their toll – rich seams of antiquity await.`,

    description: `The Chinese live to eat, expect your taste buds to be 
    tantalised, tested and treated. Wolf down Peking duck in Beijing, 
    melt over a Chongqing hotpot or grab a seasoned ròujiāmó (shredded pork in a bun) 
    before climbing Hua Shan. Gobble down a steaming bowl of Lanzhou noodles, 
    raise the temperature with some searing Hunan fare, or flag down the dim sum 
    trolley down south. Follow your nose in China and you won't want to stop travelling.`,

    China's landscapes span the range from alpha to omega: take your pick from the 
    sublime sapphire lakes of Tibet or the impassive deserts of Inner Mongolia, island-hop 
    in Hong Kong or cycle between fairy-tale karst pinnacles around Yangshuo.`,

    description: `China is off-the-scale massive. A riveting jumble of wildly 
    differing dialects and climatic and topographical extremes, it's like several 
    different countries rolled into one. Take your pick from the tossed-salad ethnic 
    mix of the southwest, the yak-butter-illuminated temple halls of Xiahe, a journey 
    along the dusty Silk Road, spending the night at Everest Base Camp, or getting into 
    your glad rags for a night on the Shanghai tiles. You're spoilt for choice.`,
