    Scores of travellers have passed overhead on their way to someplace else, 
    but years of uncertainty kept Sri Lanka off many itineraries.`,

    description: `Distances are short: see the sacred home of the world’s oldest living human-planted 
    tree in the morning (Anuradhapura) and stand awestruck by the sight of hundreds of elephants 
    gathering in the afternoon (Minneriya). Discover a favourite beach, meditate in a 2000-year-old 
    temple, exchange smiles while strolling a mellow village, marvel at birds and wildflowers, try 
    to keep count of the little dishes that come with your rice and curry. Wander past colonial gems 
    in Colombo, then hit some epic surf.`,

    description: `When you’re ready to escape the tropical climate of the 
    coast and lowlands, head for the hills, with their temperate, achingly 
    green charms. Verdant tea plantations and rain forested peaks beckon walkers, 
    trekkers and those who just want to see them from a spectacular train ride. And 
    then there are the beaches. Dazzlingly white and often untrodden, they ring the 
    island so that no matter where you go, you’ll be near a sandy gem.`,

    description: `Few places have as many Unesco World Heritage Sites (eight) 
    packed into such a small area. Sri Lanka's 2000-plus years of culture can be 
    discovered at ancient sites where legendary temples boast beautiful details 
    even as they shelter in caves or on prominent peaks. More recent are evocative 
    colonial fortresses, from Galle to Trincomalee. Safari tours of Sri Lanka’s 
    pleasantly relaxed national parks encounter leopards, water buffaloes, 
    all manner of birds and a passel of primates.`,
