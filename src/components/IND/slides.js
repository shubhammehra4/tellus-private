    description: `Distances are short: see the sacred home of the world’s oldest living human-planted 
    tree in the morning (Anuradhapura) and stand awestruck by the sight of hundreds of elephants 
    gathering in the afternoon (Minneriya). Discover a favourite beach, meditate in a 2000-year-old 
    temple, exchange smiles while strolling a mellow village, marvel at birds and wildflowers, try 
    to keep count of the little dishes that come with your rice and curry. Wander past colonial gems 
    in Colombo, then hit some epic surf.`,

    description: `When you’re ready to escape the tropical climate of the 
    coast and lowlands, head for the hills, with their temperate, achingly 
    green charms. Verdant tea plantations and rain forested peaks beckon walkers, 
    trekkers and those who just want to see them from a spectacular train ride. And 
    then there are the beaches. Dazzlingly white and often untrodden, they ring the 
    island so that no matter where you go, you’ll be near a sandy gem.`,
