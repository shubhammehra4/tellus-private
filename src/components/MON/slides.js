    description: `Mongolia's nomadic culture is famous – visitors can sleep in a 
    herder's ger (traditional felt yurt), help round up the sheep, ride horses and 
    simply 'get back to nature'. The legacy of Chinggis Khaan and resurgent nationalist 
    pride sharpens the experience. A culture of tremendous hospitality makes locals more 
    accessible. It's refreshing to meet people willing to open their doors to strangers. `,

      in Hong Kong or cycle between fairy-tale karst pinnacles around Yangshuo.`,

    description: `Mongolians are fully aware of the unique beauty of their country. 
    Ask locals and they will probably start gushing about the spectacular countryside, 
    vast steppes, rugged mountains, clear lakes and abundant wildlife and livestock. Some 
    areas are so remote you could drive a full day and see almost no signs of human 
    habitation. It’s this true wilderness experience that many people find so appealing.`,
